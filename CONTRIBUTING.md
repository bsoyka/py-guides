# Contributing

Thank you for choosing to contribute to this project! We welcome contributions
of almost any kind, including writing guides, proofreading, suggesting ideas,
and more.

## What this project is

Python Guides is a collection of Python programming guides. Each guide is a
set of well-written, well-organized, and well-commented Python code examples
with detailed information to go along with them. Each guide is intended to be
a useful reference for Python programmers of all levels, particularly
beginners.

Every guide is written in Markdown and is hosted on GitHub. With each guide
comes a different topic, and each topic helps you learn a different aspect of
Python.

## Writing guides

There are a a few guidelines to keep in mind when writing guides:

* Use Markdown and limit line lengths to 78 characters. It's helpful to
  install the [Reflow Markdown][reflow-markdown] extension for Visual Studio
  Code.
* Add a blank line between each element in the document, including headers,
  paragraphs, and code blocks.
* Include frequent code samples in the guide. This is especially important for
  guides that cover a large topic, as it helps beginners to understand the
  topic.
* Use title case for the title and sentence case for all other headers.
* Include the following at the top of the guide below the title:
  ``> *[`License`](https://github.com/bsoyka/python-guides/blob/main/LICENSE)*``

When in doubt, reference an existing guide to clarify any issues. You can also
[open a new discussion][discussion] at any time.

## Proofreading and editing

If you find a mistake in a guide, don't hesitate to fix it! Just make a fork
of this repository, fix whatever is wrong, and submit a pull request.

## Suggesting guides

We're always looking for ideas for new guides. If you have an idea for a new
topic, please [open a new discussion][discussion] and let us know!

## Committing and creating pull requests

* Please use [Gitmoji][gitmoji] whenever possible to commit your changes. We
  use :sparkles: for new guides, :bug: for fixes, :pencil2: for typo fixes,
  and :zap: for content improvements.
* Avoid using default commit messages. Instead, use a meaningful message that
  tells what you've changed.
* For new guides and most other contributions, only start work after an issue
  has been assigned to you.
