# Python Discord Guides

[![Python Discord][pydis-badge]][invite]
[![License][license-badge]][license]

Hey there! These are my personal guides to help others with their programming
questions on [Python Discord][invite]. **This project is in no way affiliated
with Python Discord.**

All guides are formatted with Markdown and located in the [`guides`][guides]
folder.

## Asking for help

If you have general Python-related questions, join [Python Discord][invite]
and take a look at the [`#❔︱how-to-get-help`][get-help] channel.

If you have any questions or comments about these guides or their content, you
can direct them to a new [GitHub discussion][discussions] or `bsoyka#0001` on
Discord.

## Contributing

**This project isn't looking for outside contributions at the moment.** If you
notice something that seems off or want to suggest a new guide, feel free to
make a GitHub [issue][issues] or [discussion][discussions] to let me know, or
send me a message at `bsoyka#0001` on Discord.
