Hey there! These are my personal guides to help others with their programming
questions on Python Discord. **This project is in no way affiliated with
Python Discord.**

All guides are formatted with Markdown and located in the `guides` folder.

## Asking for help

If you have general Python-related questions, join [Python Discord][invite]
and take a look at the [`#❔︱how-to-get-help`][get-help] channel.

If you have any questions or comments about these guides or their content, you
can direct them to a new GitHub discussion or `bsoyka#0001` on Discord.

## Contributing

**This project isn't looking for outside contributions at the moment.** If you
notice something that seems off or want to suggest a new guide, feel free to
make a GitHub issue or discussion to let me know, or send me a message at
`bsoyka#0001` on Discord.

All communication in community spaces managed in connection with this project
must follow our [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct].
