# Printing

Printing is easily the most important part of Python. It's how you can display
output to a user, and it will come in handy for almost every single program
you write.

Typically, when learning any programming language, you learn how to say "Hello, world!" So, we'll start with that:

```py
print('Hello, world!')
```

This just shows the user the words "Hello, world!", but we can do much more with it. You can print literally anything in Python, including numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, and even other functions.

```py
print(1234)
print([1, 2, 3, 4])
print({'a': 1, 'b': 2})
print(print)  # Prints: <built-in function print>
```

The `print` function is very powerful and is typically used for either debugging or displaying output to the user.
